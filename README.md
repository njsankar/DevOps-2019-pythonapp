This repository features the code and documentation used in the design and development of my DevOps project from 2019.

The purpose of this project was to create an automated deployment pipeline for an application, that will go through several steps of the Build-Test-Deploy pipeline. These include Version Control, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.
